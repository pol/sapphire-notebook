/* ================= GRID SETUP ==================
 * This mixin sets up the foundation for your grid
 * it is nescessary that this is called outside any
 * element because it provides variables that must
 * be in the global scope. Otherwise the grid system
 * won't work as excpected.

 *  .grid_setup - MIXIN
 *  The core function of the grid module, that builds up
 *  the basic structure and provides you with any number of
 *  columns with custom gap size, min-width and max-width 
 *
 *  it's also the setup function for all other grid
 *  modules. So you can define most presets in one
 *  mixin call.
 *  
 *  @width   - defines the width of the grid (any css unit)
 *  @columns - specifies the number of columns in the grid (plane number)
 *  @gap     - The gap between elements in the grid (any css unit)
 *	@align   - align the grid on left / center / right side of parent
 *  @min     - minimal width of the grid (any css unit)
 *  @max     - maximal width of the grid (any css unit)
